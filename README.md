This repository, GEE_Segmentation, offers a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating object-based image analysis (OBIA) with Google Earth Engine (GEE) for Sentinel-2 imagery. It leverages Python libraries like geemap and geopandas to perform segmentation using spectral indices and GLCM texture features. The notebook successfully implements a basic OBIA workflow, including data collection, index computation, SNIC segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. It also visualizes the results using a confusion matrix and plots the classified polygons. However, the code could benefit from improvements in error handling for large datasets, a more modular structure, performance optimizations, and enhanced documentation for better clarity and reproducibility. There are also issues with scalability, as several functions fail or abort when dealing with large datasets or feature collections.
